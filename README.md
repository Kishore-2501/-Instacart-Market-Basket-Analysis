#  Instacart Market Basket Product Reordering Prediction

This project applies deep learning to predict whether a user will reorder a product based on their past purchase behavior.

---

##  Overview

Reordering prediction is essential for e-commerce platforms to optimize inventory, recommend products, and improve customer retention. This project builds a deep learning model using structured historical purchase data to classify if a product will be reordered.

##  Dataset

This project uses the [Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017), which includes:

| File Name                    | Description                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `orders.csv`                | Order-level metadata (user ID, order number)  |
| `order_products__prior.csv` | Products from all prior orders                |
| `order_products__train.csv` | Products and labels used for training         |
| `products.csv`              | Product names and IDs                         |
| `aisles.csv`                | Aisle categories                              |
| `departments.csv`           | Department categories                         |

##  Objectives

- Build a model to predict if a user will reorder a product.
- Perform feature engineering on user, product, and user-product levels.
- Address class imbalance using class weighting.
- Evaluate the model using ROC AUC, F1-score, and classification metrics.
